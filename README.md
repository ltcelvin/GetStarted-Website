Download and View
To view this webpage, should be as easy as downloading the files from the repository and onto your local drive. Then simply click on the index.html file to start view it from your web browser of choice. 

Priority and Planning
1. To start this project, I have decided to use a responsive framework, that is, Twitter Bootstrap, I use it because I am familiar with it and also it will speed up the process rather than writing the code from scratch. That is just the first thing that struck me.
2. I want to make sure that I can replicate the Artwork as much as possible onto the HTML code, why because since this is a front end job, visual is pretty important.
3. Mobile Rsponsive - I need to make sure that the website looks great in the specified requirement, that is, iphone 6 plus, Ipad and IE10
4. Features - This is the part where I could exercise some creativity if I had time, to see if I can enhance the visual and user experience in the sense of interactivity. 
7. Lastly, Submit it on time!


PDF to Image Assets
I am running Windows, so using Sketch is apparently not an option, thus, I have decided to use the PDF version of the Artwork which I can then open it in Photoshop. I noticed that it is in high-res, 300 dpi, that isn't necessary for the initial stage of the project, so what I did was to import it in 72 dpi which is suitable for web format. And true enough, the dimensions seem to suit the scaldfolding of the Bootstrap graid system which is ideal. I contemplated using web fonts or glyphicons to replace the Artwork's icons but then I wanted to show that I can completely recreate and convert an Artwork into HTML format so I have had to cut the Artwork up and export some of the imagery to be used for the website. I have also decided to use sprites for some imagery where it make sense.

Development Tools
My resources are limited in that I didn't have a web server or a proper IDE and so, I've had to rely on Sublime, Free version for Windows for coding and Chrome for debugging. I do however have Photoshop installed so I could process the Artwork. I have also used Google fonts to try and match the Artwork, instead of using a web safe fonts which I initially wanted to use.

Improvements and what could have been
1. I know I said I wanted to replicate the design as much as possible but I actually improvised and change it slightly. If you look at the top nav bar and the footer, it is not fluid like how it suggests in the Artwork. I just went with my gut and follow what is conventional and look good. This way, the content is consistent and aligned. 
2. If I had time, I will fix the transitional bug of the blog carousel, as well as find a better solution for the blog carousel, rather to resorting to Bootstrap's built-in carousel which can be limiting in more ways than one. 
3. As mentioned, if I had a choice, I would recommend the designer to use embedded fonts for icons because it is reusable, scalable and can be customised by code. Of course, only when it is applicable. 
4. Definitely make thorough checks on mobile devices and make sure that i responds well to popular format and devices. As well as W3C compliance. 
5. I might also have downloaded the source files from Bootstrap and make use of LESS to more efficiently produce the work.
6. I would also love to improve of the enhancements and effects of the interaction on the website. For example, add a bit of animation or transition on buttons or menus.
